# Pokemon challenge with React

The challenge was developed with React V17 with the objective of create a basic application with routing between links.

# Requirements
React application
    Create a react web application that fetches Pokémon from Pokémon Public API
    (https://pokeapi.co/). The application should retrieve all the Pokémon to show them in a list with
    pagination where the user can select the number of items per page (default 25). The list page should
    show the name of the Pokémon, the image (sprite), the number of abilities it has and a link to the
    single page for each Pokémon. The Pokémon page should include all the possible information about
    the Pokémon (we will love to see how you can create or use different components).
Considerations 
     You can use react tools and frameworks.
     You can use third party components.
     State management tools are also welcome.
     You need to include a README file that includes a summary of the implementation and all
    the instructions for deployment.
